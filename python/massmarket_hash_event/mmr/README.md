# Merkle Mountain Range for Immediately Verifiable and Efficiently Replicable Commitments

Forked the code from https://github.com/robinbryce/draft-bryce-cose-merkle-mountain-range-proofs

Mostly for convenience since in it's upstream form the python code wasn't immediately usable.

## Primary changes

* fixed imports
* changed hash function to sha3/keccak
