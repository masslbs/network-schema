// This file defines the transport protocol between relays and clients.
// It's main purpose is transfer of events of the higher application levels.
// It is orthogonal to the shop registry and other smart contracts.
//
// Messages must be prefixed with their acompanying encoding number
// as a single byte. encoding.txt defines the number for each message.
//
// Furthermore, we expect only one message per write/binary frame.
// This means no buffering of multiple messages into a single write.
// The protocol offers repeated fields where approriate for higher throughput.
// A suggested transport is WebSocket over HTTPS but the protocol is
// agnostic, as long as it can handle binary data and keeps the framing intact.
// This design, specifically the push from the relay to client, assumes
// the transport does not offer backpressure. No further pushes are sent
// until they are acknowledged by the client.
//
// For upgrades there exists a VERSION file in the root of the repository.
// The VERSION is a single unsigned integer, incremented for each change.
// The client and relay must agree on the VERSION before starting the protocol.
// In the case of WebSocket, the VERSION can be compared via the URL.
// The relay must close the connection if the VERSION isn't supported.
